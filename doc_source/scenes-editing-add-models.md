1. On the scene composer page, choose the plus \(**\+**\) sign, and then choose **Add 3D model**\.

1. On the **Add resource from resource library** window, choose the **CookieFactorMixer\.glb** file, and then choose **Add**\. Scene composer opens\.

1. **Optional**: Choose the plus \(**\+**\) sign, and then choose **Add light**\.

1. Choose each light option to see how they affect the scene\.
