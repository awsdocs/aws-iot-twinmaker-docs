# Create your scenes<a name="scenes-creation"></a>

In this section, you'll set up a scene so that you can edit your digital twin\. You'll need to create one or more scenes before you create your digitial twin \. There are two main approaches to creating a scene: you can import a single glTF file that has the entire model for your site\. Or, you can import an environment model, such as a building or a space, and then import separate glTF files for each piece of equipment and position them relative to their physical location\.

**Note**  
Before you create a scene, you must have created a workspace\.

Use the following procedure to create your scene in AWS IoT TwinMaker\.

1. To open the scene pane, in the left navigation of your workspace, choose **Scene Composer**\.
